## Some R code basics

* `<-` is known as an "assignment operator" -- it means "Make the object named to the left equal to the output of the code to the right"
* `&` means AND, in Boolean logic
* `|` means OR, in Boolean logic
* `!` means NOT, in Boolean logic
* When referring to values entered as text, or to dates, put them in quote marks like this: `"United States"`, or `"2016-07-26"`. Numbers are not quoted
* When entering two or more values as a list, combine them using the function `c`, for combine, with the values separated by commas, for example: `c("2017-07-26", "2017-08-04")`
* As in a spreadsheet, you can specify a range of values with a colon, for example: `c(1:10)` creates a list of integers (whole numbers) from one to ten.
* Some common operators:
	* `+` `-` add, subtract
	* `*` `/` multiply, divide
	* `>` `<` greater than less than
	* `>=` `<=` greater than or equal to, less than or equal to
	* `!=` not equal to
* **Equal signs can be confusing**
	* `==` tests whether the objects on either end are equal. This is often used in filtering data
	* `=` makes an object equal to a value, which is similar to `<-` but used within a function.
* Handling null values:
	* Nulls are designated as `NA`
	* `is.na(x)` looks for nulls within variable `x`.
	* `!is.na(x) looks for non-null values within variable `x`

Here, `is.na()` is a **function**. Functions are followed by parentheses, and act on code/data in the parentheses.

## R Workspace

* Your current R working environment
* Includes any user-defined objects (e.g. vectors, data frames, functions)

| Function | Action |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `getwd()`   | List current working directory |
| `setwd("mydirectory")` | Change the current working directory to my directory |
| `ls()`    | List the objects in the current work space |
| `rm(object)`    | Delete object |
| `save(objectlist, file="myfile)`    | Save specific objects to a file |
| `load("myfile")`    | Load a work space into the current session (default = .RData) |

## Packages

* Collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in well-defined format
* Massively extend the functionality of R
* Thousands of user-written packages on CRAN
	* [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

Mac users may need to alter their security preferences to allow apps authored by non-Apple developers to install. If you notice an error, try to change [your system preferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpVqkyXFy4).

## Getting Help

| Function | Action |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `help.start()`   | General help |
| `help("foo")` or `?foo` | Help on function foo (the quotation marks are optional) |
| `help.search("foo")` or `??foo`    | Search the help system for instances of the string foo |
| `example("foo")`    | Examples of function foo (the quotation marks are optional) |

## Working with Packages

* install.packages("*packagename*")
* update.packages()


* library(*packagename*)
* help(package="*packagename*")


* library() #what packages are in the library
* search() #what packages are loaded

## Common Mistakes

* **Using the wrong case**
	* help(), Help(), and HELP() are three different functions (and only the first one will work)
* **Forgetting to use quotation marks when they are needed**
	* install.packages("gclus") will work, while install.packages(gclus) will generate an error.
* **Forgetting to include the parentheses in a function call**
	* help() rather than help. Even if there are no options, you still need the().
* **Using the `\` in a path name on Windows**
	* R sees the backlash character as an escape character.
	* `setwd("c:\mydata")` will generate an error. Use `setwd("c:/mydata")` or `setwd("c:\\mydata")` instead
* **Using a function from a package that is not loaded**
	* For example: The function `str_trim()` is contained in the **stringr** package. 
	* If you try to use it before loading the package, you will get an error
